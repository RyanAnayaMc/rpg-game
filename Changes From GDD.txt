Changes from GDD:

CONTENT
- Story and character sprites are mostly placeholder assets from RPGMaker (except main character)
 - Actual main side quest not yet implemented, just basic things to test mechanics
 - Hub area and quests not yet implemented
- Instead of having 2 main sidequests for the final game it will just be one but it will have a mini-story
 - It is the second one mentioned in the GDD - distribution of magical substances and using an RV for it
- Tutorial for combat not yet implemented

GEAR
- Character can only equip one weapon (instead of two)

 - Encounters start based on world interactions

COMBAT
- Introduced new stat: SP (Special Points)
  - Shows up on combat HUD
  - SP cannot exceed MaxSP, just like how HP cannot exceed MaxHP
